Video Frame Embedding Storage
This project processes video files by extracting individual frames using OpenCV, converting them into vector embeddings, and storing them in ChromaDB for efficient similarity search and retrieval. The pipeline enables semantic search across video content by analyzing frame-level visual features.
Key features:

Video-to-frame extraction with OpenCV
Frame-to-embedding conversion for semantic representation
ChromaDB integration for scalable vector storage and querying
